# Stardew Valley API

An API that can be used for retrieving data about the game Stardew Valley!


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Express, JavaScript, HTML

Server-side built using Express. The API is hardcoded in the server file with JavaScript.

## Optimizations

I plan to move all the hardcoded API data over to MongoDB and access it with Express.
Right now the API has information only on one area of the game--crops, I would like to add more useful categories and data to the API.

## Lessons Learned:

One of my first experiences with Express. After utilizing many API's this was my first experience building an API myself and learning the different components that go into that.
